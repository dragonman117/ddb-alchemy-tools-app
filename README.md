# D&D Beyond - Alchemy Tools App

This is a simple app that helps users download the Alchemy formatted json of D&D Beyond Monsters (in the future this may change as more abilities are added).

This is a sub-project of [D&D Beyond Alchemy Tools](https://github.com/dragonman117/ddb-alchemy-tools) and exists to make it easier for end users to use.

## Installation

Please download the latest release from the releases page.

## Notes

This is a very early version of this app. I plan on adding a lot of improvements as I find time, and as I learn more about Electron.

## Running From Source

If you wish to run this from source, please follow the steps below.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn start`

## Todo List

- [ ] Clean Up Tech Debt (code is a little messy)
- [ ] Improve UI (would like to integrate Vue rather than bare js)
- [ ] Add Icon
- [ ] Add Linux Installer
- [ ] Add automated build/deploy pipeline
- [ ] Add in place update functionality
